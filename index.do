# Embeding Stata results in .html  

### Author, ScM



**Methods:** 
This website is a practice for using dyndoc to transfer do file html

```
<<dd_do:nooutput>>
 cls

 clear

set obs 30


gen age=(rnormal()*15)+57 

gen age_t=(rt(_N)*15)+57

hist age, ///
fcolor(orange%40) /// simulated normal 
addplot(hist age_t, fcolor(midblue%50)) /// simulated t-distributio 
normal /// theoretical normal
legend(on ///
lab(1 "Sampled from Normal") ///
lab(2 "Theoretical Normal") ///
lab(3 "Sampled from t-distribution") ///
          )


graph export hist_age.png, replace
<</dd_do>>
```

<<dd_graph>>

```


**Results:** 
We found that the shapes of the graphs are different. Then, they made do-file which will be converted to html byÂ dyndoc. They also got used to Greek symbols in the result section like
$\text{Age, years} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=57,\,\sigma^{2}=225)$

**Conclusions:** 
In walking you through syntax, do-file creation, queued commands, generated results, through to embedding neatly formatted output in
.html, we believe you now have a sense of what that Stata might offer you. These ideas can be generalized to embedding results 
in .xlsx, .log, .dta, .docx, etc.
